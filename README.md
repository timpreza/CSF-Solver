Coded in C++, this program will find the following for concurrent system of forces:
  - Resultant and magnitude
  - Orientation of angle with respect to x-axis
  - Quadrant location
  
The following information is needed for the program:
  - Unit type
  - All force values
  - All angle values

Limitations:
